            <p id= "bio">“Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent”
― Victor hugo. My hobby is playing the violin. Violin is the hardest instrument but it is easy for me since i have been learning it since i was 3 years old. I am now 11 years old and in violin i am in grade 5. A fact about te violin is that The word “violin” comes from the medieval Latin word vitula. What makes this one of the funniest violin facts is that oddly enough, the modern Latin translation of vitula also means “female cow.”  </p>
